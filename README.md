# Bulma Skins

A versatile Vue component library built with Bulma CSS, featuring customizable themes and a full suite of form components.  Utilizes bulma.io components and some extensions to build UIs using centralize pre-build components.  There is a full set of Skinning available that can theme the components based on the list of available skins that are a conversion of the skins found on the bootstrap skins found at https://bootswatch.com/.

To add to your interface simply import the appropriate dist/components.js file and have the dist/style.css in the same location.  For example if using 
the esm module loading, import {} from 'dist/components.esm.js';
