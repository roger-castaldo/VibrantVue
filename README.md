# Vibrant Vue

A versatile Vue component library built with Bulma CSS, featuring customizable themes and a full suite of form components.

To add to your interface simply import the appropriate dist/vibrantvue.js file and have the dist/vibrantvue.css in the same location.  For example if using 
the esm module loading, import {} from 'dist/vibrantvue.esm.js';
